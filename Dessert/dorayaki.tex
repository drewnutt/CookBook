    \ingredients{%
	    4 & eggs \\
	    \unit[137]{g} & sugar \\
	    \unit[2]{tbsp} & honey \\
	    \unit[160]{g} & all purpose flour \\
	    \unit[1]{tsp} & baking powder \\
	    \unit[1-2]{tbsp} & water \\
	    \unit[1]{tsp} & neutral oil \\
	    \unit[1.1]{lb} & red bean paste (anko)
    }

    \preparation{%
	    \step In a large bowl, combine eggs, sugar, and honey and whisk well until the mixture becomes fluffy.
	    \step Sift flour and baking powder into the bowl and mix all together. Keep in the fridge to rest for 15 minutes.
	    \step The batter should be slightly smoother now. Stir in 1 Tbsp of water. Depends on the size of eggs and how accurate your flour measurement is, the water amount may vary but it should be 1-2 Tbsp.
	    \step Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium-low heat (in between 250 and 300 \faren). It's best to take your time and heat slowly. Dip a paper towel in vegetable oil and coat the bottom of the pan with the oil. Then remove the oil completely (that's the key for evenly golden brown dorayaki surface). With a ladle or a small measuring cup (I use a \nicefrac{1}{4} cup measuring cup), pour 3 Tbsp of the batter from 3" (8 cm) above the pan to create 3" (8 cm) diameter pancakes.
