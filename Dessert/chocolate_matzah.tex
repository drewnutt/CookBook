	\ingredients[]{%
		\unit[1]{cup} & salted butter \\
		\unit[1]{cup} & dark brown sugar \\
		6 & matzos \\
		\unit[20]{oz} & semisweet chocolate chips \\
		\unit[\nicefrac{1}{2}]{cup} & pecans \\
	}

	\preparation{%
		\step Melt the butter in a saucepan, then add the brown sugar and stir until dissolved.
		\step Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.
		\step Preheat the oven to 325\faren.
		\step Spread the matzah out on a couple of baking sheets and pour the hot mixture on top of the matzah. Spread out the sugar mixture with a rubber spatula.
		\step Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, or until the sugar mixture is bubbly and thick.
		\step Immediately cover with chocolate and place back in the oven to melt the chocolate. Spread the chocolate out with a rubber spatula.
		\step Put the matzah into the fridge to harden the chocolate.
		\step Once the chocolate is hardened, you can remove them from the baking sheets and store them in the freezer in a bag for as long as you would like (I don't think it can go bad in the freezer).
