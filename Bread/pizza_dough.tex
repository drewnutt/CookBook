\preparation{
\step Pour 3/4 cup warm water into small bowl; stir in yeast. Let stand until yeast dissolves, about 5 minutes.
\step Mix 2 cups flour, sugar, and salt in mixer.
\step Add yeast mixture and 3 tablespoons oil; process until dough forms a sticky ball.
\step Transfer to lightly floured surface. Knead dough until smooth, adding more flour by tablespoonfuls if dough is very sticky, about 1 minute. You can also do this in the mixer.
\step Transfer to a bowl coated in oil; turn dough in bowl to coat with oil. Cover bowl and let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
\step Punch down dough. Roll out dough. Start in center of dough, working outward toward edges but not rolling over them.
}
\hint{
This recipe can be done a day ahead. Leave the dough in the fridge after kneading and take it out a couple of hours before to let rise before rolling out.
