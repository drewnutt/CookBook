\preparation{%
\step Preheat oven to about 350\faren. Heat 4-5 tablespoons of oil in a large cast iron pan.
\step Chop the onions and peppers and saute in the hot pan until dark brown.
\step Add the garlic, paprika, cumin, cayenne and salt. Saute for about 5 more minutes.
\step Add the crushed tomatoes and let simmer. The length of this simmer is up to you, a longer simmer means a chunkier final product.
\step Dig out a small hole, go all the way to the bottom of the pan and crack an egg into it. Repeat this 3-5 more times.
\step Crack some fresh pepper on top of the eggs. Crumble the entire block of feta, covering the entire pan with cheese. 
\step Put in the oven and cook until the eggs have set. Should take about 10 minutes, but keep an eye on them so you can get nice runny eggs.
