    	}
    	\preparation{%
        		\step Preheat oven on broil setting. Prick eggplants several times with a fork. Broil them until brown/black on the outside, about 15 minutes, flipping halfway.
        		\step Let eggplants cool and then peel off the skin. Place them on a flat surface and flatten using a fork, making sure the stem stays intact. 
        		\step Beat eggs in a shallow bowl or baking tray, add salt and pepper to taste. You will need 1-2 eggs per eggplant. Dip the flattened eggplants into the mixture, ensuring both sides are soaked.
        		\step Heat a skillet with oil (about 1 cm depth) and proceed to fry the eggplants. Fry about 3-4 minutes per side on medium heat.
        		\step After frying, set eggplants aside on paper towels so the oil can drain. Serve with rice and banana ketchup.
