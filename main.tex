\section{Introduction}
Welcome to our cookbook. It's simply a compilation of recipes we have enjoyed over the past couple of years. Most recipes are vegetarian (because we are). Recipes have been found from all over the internet and from friends and family. If the section headings aren't what you are looking for, we would recommend looking in the index. We have tagged most recipes with relevant tags so you can find exactly what you want.

\suggestion{ \begin{itemize}
    \item You can add 4 dried kashmiri chilies at the beginning if you want extra heat, but the 4 green chilies are plenty
    \item Instead of the 5 tomatoes you can use 600 grams crushed tomatoes. Then you can avoid cutting up the tomatoes!

{Baba Ganoush}
\index{Eggplant}\index{Vegan}\index{Mediterranean}
\ingredients[]{
1 & large eggplant (or 2-3 small) \\
\unit[2]{tbsp} & tahini \\
1-2 & garlic cloves, chopped \\
\unit[1]{tbsp} & lemon juice \\
to taste & salt and pepper\\
\unit[\nicefrac{1}{4}]{tsp} & crushed red pepper \\
\unit[1]{tsp} & sumac, optional
}
\preparation{%
\step Smoke the eggplant. Turn 1 gas burner on medium or high (will depend on the burner). Using a pair of tongs, turn eggplant every 5 minutes or so until the eggplant is completely tender and it’s skin is charred and crispy (about 15 to 20 minutes.) Don’t worry if the eggplant deflates, it’s supposed to. (You can also do this on a gas or charcoal grill over medium-high heat.) Remove from heat and let the eggplant cool.
\step Once eggplant is cool enough to touch, peel the charred crispy skin off. Discard the stem. Transfer eggplant flesh to a colander; let drain for 3 minutes.
\step Transfer eggplant flesh to the bowl of a food processor. Add tahini paste, yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, and sumac (if using). Give it just a couple of pulses to combine (do not over blend, you want to keep it chunky).
\step Transfer the baba ganoush spread to a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate for an hour (if you don’t have the time, try refrigerating for a few minutes to let the flavors meld and the baba ganoush thicken a bit). Just before serving, top the baba ganoush with a sprinkle of sumac, olive oil, toasted pine nuts, parsley leaves, or anything other Mediterranean spice. Enjoy with a side of warm pita bread or pita chips. 
}
\hint{
If you do not have the means to cook the eggplant over an open flame, you can roast the eggplant in the oven at 425 \faren for about 30-40 min. Cut the eggplant in half and make slits in the skin before roasting.

\step Heat 1.5 tablespoons of oil in a deep skillet set over medium-high heat. Add the rice and stir constantly until the rice begins to turn golden brown. The toastier your rice, the tastier it will be.
\step Next, add the chicken stock. The mixture will bubble up, and should be followed immediately by the tomato paste or tomato sauce, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, chili powder, black pepper, and salt.
\step Bring to a boil, stirring the tomato paste to dissolve it if using, and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Immediately turn the heat down to low and set a timer for 20 minutes.
\step You may want to check on moisture levels while the rice is cooking. If it looks like the rice needs more water, add \nicefrac{1}{4} cup at a time or until you think the rice is cooked well.
\step When the rice is done, fluff it with a fork and serve!

\hint{
\begin{itemize}
    \item If you don't have tomato paste, you can replace it with \nicefrac{1}{2} cup of plain tomato sauce.
    \item Feel free to add more of the spices than in the recipe. The first time I made this, I accidentally doubled the amounts, and it still turned out great.

	\step Roast the poblanos over the stove (using the flame or in a pan). Once they are blackened all over, place immediately into a plastic bag (shopping bag is perfect) and then tie off the bag.
	\step Blend the can of peeled tomatoes. Optionally, you can add jalape\~{n}os to the blender as well. Pour the blended tomatoes into a small pot.
	\step Add salt, pepper, and other spices (oregano, cumin, etc.) as you like to the blended tomatoes. Bring up to heat, but do not boil.
	\step Chop onions and put in a medium frying pan on medium-high heat. Add in minced garlic and meat of your choice. Cook until the meat is fully cooked then remove from heat.
	\step Once the poblanos have cooled down, remove them from the bag and peel off the blackened skin and make a small incision to remove most of the insides.
	\step Stuff the poblanos partially with mozzarella (or other white melting cheese), then add the onion-meat mixture, then fill the rest with more mozzarella.
	\step Separate the egg whites from the egg yolks. Combine the egg whites in a large bowl and whisk until you reach soft peaks. Slowly fold in the yolks to the whipped egg whites.
	\step In a large pan, heat enough oil to shallow-fry the chiles on medium-high heat. Place all of the flour in a shallow bowl.
	\step One at a time, dunk a stuffed poblano into the flour then into the egg mixture, then place into the frying oil. Avoid crowding the pan. Flip after about 3-4 minutes, or when slightly browned and crispy, then fry for an additional 2-3 minutes until both sides are well cooked.

\step Mix the yeast, sugar and warm water(warm but should be able to keep a finger in it for a bit) in the bowl of the stand mixer. Let stand for about 5 minutes
\step Melt the butter and combine with the milk and salt. Add the mixture to the yeast mixture. Add 130 grams (1 cup) of the flour and mix until a clumpy mixture is formed.
\step Add the remaining 585 grams of flour to the stand mixture, gradually, mixing as you add. Mix unitl a shaggy, floury dough is formed.
\step Knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes. Add flour if the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl a tablespoon at a time. Dough should form a ball without sagging, and spring back when poked.
\step Grease a large bowl and transfer the dough to the greased bowl. Flip the dough ball so it is covered in oil. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about one hour.
\step Split the dough into two equal pieces and form each piece into a loose ball. Let rest for 10 minutes.
\step Grease 2 loaf pans. Smash a ball into a rectangle with the palms of your hand. Then fold the rectangle into overlapping thirds, pinch to close the sides and the ends. Fold in half by pressing down in the middle and bringing the sides together, pinch to close on the ends and side. Repeat for the second loaf.
\step Move the loaves to the loaf pans, by flipping them seam side down. Then let rest in a warm place until they start to dome over the sides of the pan, about an hour.
\step Heat the oven to 425 \faren. Slash the top of the loaves with a serated knife before you put them in the oven. When you add the loaves to the oven reduce the heat to 375\faren. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes. They should sound hollow when tapped.

\step Stir in yeast mixture and beaten egg and knead until smooth and elastic, 8-10 minutes. The dough will be on the sticky side, so it can be a bit messy. Try and leave the dough tackier than you would a round loaf.
\step Shape dough into a ball and return it to the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 1-2 hours.
\step Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Divide the dough into 8 equal parts. Gently roll each into a ball and arrange 2-3 inches apart on the baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or towel and let buns rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours.
\step Set a large shallow pan of water on the oven floor. Preheat oven to 400\faren with rack in center. Beat remaining egg with 1 tbsp water and brush on top of buns. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.
\step Bake buns, turning sheet halfway through, for about 15 minutes, until tops are golden brown. Transfer to a rack to cool completely.

\index{Tortilla}\index{Mexican}\index{No Yeast}
\ingredients[9]{
\unit[2\nicefrac{1}{2}]{cups} (298g) & all-purpose flour \\
\unit[1]{tsp} & baking powder \\
\unit[\nicefrac{1}{2}]{tsp} & salt \\
\unit[\nicefrac{1}{4}]{cup of any} & lard (57g), butter (57g), shortening (48g), or vegetable oil (50g)\\
\unit[\nicefrac{3}{4}-1]{cup} & hot water
}
\preparation{
\step In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
\step Add the lard (or butter, or shortening; if you're using vegetable oil, add it in step 3). Use your fingers or a pastry blender to work the fat into the flour until it disappears. Coating most of the flour with fat inhibits gluten formation, making the tortillas easier to roll out.
\step Pour in the lesser amount of hot water (plus the oil, if you're using it), and stir briskly with a fork or whisk to bring the dough together into a shaggy mass. Stir in additional water as needed to bring the dough together.
\step Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead briefly, just until the dough forms a ball. If the dough is very sticky, gradually add a bit more flour.
\step Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Round the pieces into balls, flatten slightly, and allow them to rest, covered, for about 30 minutes (see tips, below). If you wish, coat each ball lightly in oil before covering; this ensures the dough doesn't dry out (not necessary though).
\step While the dough rests, preheat an ungreased cast iron griddle or skillet over medium high heat, about 400\faren.
\step Working with one piece of dough at a time, roll into a round about 8" in diameter. Keep the remaining dough covered while you work. Fry the tortilla in the ungreased pan for about 30 seconds on each side, or until air bubble form and browning occurs on each side. Repeat with the remaining dough balls.
}
\hint{
Use just enough water to bring the dough together. Too much water and you'll end up with a sticky dough that is difficult to handle.

\unit[2]{cups}(270g) + \unit[\nicefrac{1}{4}]{cup} & atta (whole wheat flour) \\
\unit[1-2]{tsp} & oil, optional\\
\unit[around \nicefrac{3}{4}]{cup} & water \\
some & ghee
}
\preparation{
\step Take 2 cups (270 grams) atta in a large bowl. You can add little oil if you like here, but this is completely optional.
\step Start adding water, little by little. As you add water, mix with your hands and bring the dough together. You may need more or less water depending on the kind of flour.
\step Once the dough comes together, start kneading the dough. Knead with the knuckles of your finger, applying pressure.
\step Fold the dough using your palms and knead again applying pressure with your knuckles. Keep kneading until the dough feels soft and pliable. If it feels hard/tight, add little water and knead again. If it feels too sticky/soft, add some dry flour and mix.
\step Once done, the dough should be smooth. Press the dough with your fingers, it should leave an impression.
\step Cover the dough with a damp cloth or paper towel for 20 to 30 minutes.
\step After the dough has rested, give it a quick knead again. Divide the dough into 12 equal parts, each weighing around 35 to 37 grams.
\step Start working with one ball, while keep the remaining dough balls covered with a damp cloth so that they don't dry out.
\step Take one of the balls and press it between your fingers to make it smooth. Then roll it between your palms to make it round and smooth. There should be no cracks. Press the round dough ball and flatten it slightly.
\step Now take around 1/4 cup atta in a plate for dusting the roti while rolling it. Dip the prepared dough ball into the dry flour and dust it from all sides.
\step Then start rolling the roti, using a rolling board and rolling pin. Roll it thin until you have a 5 to 6 inch diameter circular roti. You will have to dip the roti in dry flour several times while rolling the roti. Anytime the dough starts sticking to the rolling pin, dip the roti into the atta from both sides and then continue rolling.
\step Heat the tawa (skillet) on medium-high heat. Make sure the tawa is hot enough before you place the roti on the tawa. Dust excess flour off the rolled roti and place it on the hot tawa.
\step Let it cook for 15-30 seconds until you see some bubbles on top side. At this point flip the roti, you don't want the first side to cook too much.
\step Now, let the other side cook more than the first side, around 30 seconds more. Use a tong to see how much it has cooked from the second side now. If you see brown spots all over, means it has cooked enough.
\step Now, remove the roti from the tawa using a tong and place it directly on flame with the first side (which was little less cooked) directly on the flame. The roti if rolled evenly will puff up, flip with a tong to cook the other side as well. The roti is done when it has brown spots, don't burn it.
\step Apply ghee on the rotis immediately. Make all the roti similarly. Serve warm.
}
\hint{
If you have an induction stovetop, you can still make these. Instead of placing the roti directly on the flame, flip back onto the hot tawa (first side on bottom) and press roti with a paper towel, cotton cloth, or spatula. It will puff up.
